# laptop-price-prediction
This project is focused on predicting the price of laptops using a machine learning model. The primary goal is to build a model that accurately predicts prices based on various features such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, etc. The Random Forest Regressor algorithm was selected for its robustness and ability to handle complex data with multiple features.
